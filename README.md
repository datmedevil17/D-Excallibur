## About the Game

Excalibur transports players into a high-stakes futuristic arena where every decision, shot, and strategy matters. Powered by the decentralized Monad blockchain, each match outcome, weapon purchase, and skin unlock is recorded on-chain, granting true digital ownership and provable scarcity. Players can customize their loadouts, experiment with varied weapon mechanics—from rapid-fire pistols to high-impact railguns—and adapt to dynamic maps that shift in real time.

The game features a risk-reward economy: earn tokens through skillful play, spend them on exclusive NFT skins and weapons, or trade them on secondary markets. Our AI-driven matchmaking ensures balanced 1v1 duels, while the respawn system keeps the action continuous. With immersive 3D graphics rendered via Three.js and responsive controls built in React, Excalibur delivers a smooth, competitive experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
